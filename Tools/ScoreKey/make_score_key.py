"""Puts the ranking API's signing key into the Firestore rules.

The ranking API (freny-online, api/run/finish) signs the scores of the runs it checked with the
SCORE_KEY env var on Vercel; the rules only take scores with that signature. The key must not be
committed (this repository is public), and the game no longer has it:
  python Tools/ScoreKey/make_score_key.py <key-file>
    writes Tools/ScoreKey/firestore.rules.publish (git-ignored): firebase/firestore.rules with the
    key in place of __SCORE_KEY__, ready to paste in the Firebase console.
  python Tools/ScoreKey/make_score_key.py --new <key-file>
    makes a new random key first. Changing the key needs new rules AND the new SCORE_KEY on
    Vercel at the same time.
